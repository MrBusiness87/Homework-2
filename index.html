            <p class="card-text">Hello, thank you for coming to visit my page, hope you enjoy what I have done with the
              place!</br>I was born inside of <u>Yugoslavia</u>, the summer of <b>1987</b>. Already had a brother, so my
              parents had some experience with raising kids. Eventually, in <b>1992</b>, the Balkan Civil War broke out
              and we fled to <u>Germany</u>, now I'm fluent in German. Years later we came to <u>Raleigh, NC, USA,</u>
              while Bill Clinton was President. I studied and learned my third language, and through the years studied
              hard enough to earn a Bachelors in General Business Administration from NCCU. In years to come I learned
              spanish and perfected my tutoring technique, also the thirst for knowledge is staying thirsty, mainly that
              is because of the movie "The Peak".</br></br><span style="color: palegreen;">At this current point in life
                I have achieved:</span>
              <ul style="color:palegreen;">
                <li>Living in 3 Countries</li>
                <li>Crossed an Ocean</li>
                <li>Fluent in 3, Understand 5, languages</li>
                <li>Bachelor's Degree in General Business Administration</li>
                <li>Learning is always an uphill battle, but it is just as rewarding.</li>
                <li>Figured out that having many hobbies is not a bad thing.</li>
                <li>Having Cats is the coolest thing in the world!!!!</li>

                style="color:lightblue;">Pollux</span>! Castra is in the Triangle!</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Castra and Pollux are currently, in <b>2020</b>, 2 years old.</br>They are <i>North
                American Shorthair</i> and from the same litter. Castra and Pollux got their names from the
              <b>GEMINI</b> zodiac sign; the twins original names are Castor and Pollux. Seeing as my birthday is
              <b>JUNE 5th</b>, I chose to give them those names. They are my first outside of the family pets. My dad
              and I used to breed and sell guppies, neon, and other smaller breed tank fish in <u>Germany</u>. It was my
              past time to collecting stamps and having one of the most complete and largest collection of
              KinderEier&reg; toy collectibles, at the time in <b>1997</b>. Castra is the little cutie posing in the
              triangle, which I am sure they have destroyed by the time you are reading this. Pollux is the big guy
              sitting like a gentleman watching over his little sister. Pollux is bigger than Castra by a few pounds,
              but don't discount Castra, she will put Pollux in his place, real quick!</p>
